# ✦ Landix Art

**UI library for Design Engineers.**  
Free and open-source animated components and effects built with Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn and Motion.

## 📖 The Story: Why Landix Art?

Landix originally started as a simple, traditional premium template marketplace. We sold static templates to developers who needed to build landing pages quickly.

However, we noticed a recurring problem: **Developers didn't want rigid templates; they wanted composable pieces.** They wanted to extract that *one cool animated button* or that *specific scrolling marquee* without ripping apart an entire template.

With the rise of tools like `shadcn/ui`, the paradigm shifted. Developers prefer copy-pasting raw, accessible code that they fully control. 

So, we made a hard pivot. We dismantled our premium templates, extracted all the highly-animated, complex UI sections, rewrote them using **Motion** and **Tailwind CSS**, aligned their architecture with **shadcn/ui**, and open-sourced them. 

Now, Landix is a premium library of copy-and-paste elements designed for maximum customizability. It empowers developers to launch modern, animation-heavy SaaS landing pages with just a few lines of code, maintaining full control over the output.
